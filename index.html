        <p>Natron is an open-source (MPLv2 license) video compositing software, similar in functionality to Adobe After Effects or Nuke by The Foundry. It is cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows).</p>

<p>The project home page is <a href="http://natron.inria.fr">http://natron.inria.fr</a>
The project source code repository is <a href="https://github.com/MrKepzie/Natron">https://github.com/MrKepzie/Natron</a></p>

<p>Compositing is the process of blending real or virtual images together in order to produce an output image.
It has a wide range of applications but mainly this is used in the visual effects production.</p>

<p>In order to composite images, you define image transformations, or operators, such as a box blur and you connect and blend the transformations together to produce a final image.</p>

<p>The chain of transformation applied to an image is called a compositing tree. An example of a compositing tree would be the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Read image A</p></li>
<li><p>Read Image B</p></li>
<li><p>Merge A over B with alpha blending</p></li>
<li><p>Apply a box blur on the result</p></li>
</ul><p>In Natron we support OpenFX which defines a standard for writing visual effects/image processing plug-ins for a compositing software. This is really important as today over 500 plug-in exist and are widely used by the cinema industry. Those plug-ins can implement cutting edge computer vision/graphics algorithms and this is where Natron can become helpful for the research and education in computer vision/graphics:</p>

<p>500 lines of code are generally  enough to implement an OpenFX plug-in with multi-threading support. If you're worried about performances, GPU acceleration is possible with 3rd party libraries. </p>

<p>Once a plug-in has been developed you can couple it with other plug-ins and watch the results. Also it will work on all the softwares that currently support OpenFX, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nuke by the Foundry</p></li>
<li><p>Sony Vegas</p></li>
<li><p>Assimilate SCRATCH</p></li>
<li><p>DaVinci resolve by Blackmagic Design</p></li>
<li><p>DustBuster</p></li>
<li><p>Baselight</p></li>
<li><p>Autodesk Toxic</p></li>
</ul><p>and Natronâ€¦ which is the only open-source graphical software supporting it.</p>

<p>In order to be able to be ready for production of visual effects on movies Natron has a few other features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Animation of visual effects over the time</p></li>
<li><p>Performances and ability to deal with very large images (tested on 27000x15000 images)</p></li>
<li><p>Dozens of image/video file formats supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Color management via OpenColorIO</p></li>
<li><p>Command-line support for render farm purpose</p></li>
</ul><p>As of today we're working on a rotoscoping node to be able to create and edit masks in Natron.
