Maintenance
-----------

Natron includes a maintenance tool called 'NatronSetup', with this application you can easily upgrade Natron and it's components when a new version is available. You can also add or remove individual packages, or remove Natron completely. The application should be in the same start menu folder as Natron, or you can start it from the folder where you installed Natron.
