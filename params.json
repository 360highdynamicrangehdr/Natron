{"name":"Natron","tagline":"Computer-vision Computer-graphics VFX visual effects compositing","body":"Natron is an open-source (MPLv2 license) video compositing software, similar in functionality to Adobe After Effects or Nuke by The Foundry. It is cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows).\r\n\r\nThe project home page is http://natron.inria.fr\r\nThe project source code repository is https://github.com/MrKepzie/Natron\r\n\r\nCompositing is the process of blending real or virtual images together in order to produce an output image.\r\nIt has a wide range of applications but mainly this is used in the visual effects production.\r\n\r\nIn order to composite images, you define image transformations, or operators, such as a box blur and you connect and blend the transformations together to produce a final image.\r\n\r\nThe chain of transformation applied to an image is called a compositing tree. An example of a compositing tree would be the following:\r\n\r\n- Read image A\r\n\r\n- Read Image B\r\n\r\n- Merge A over B with alpha blending\r\n\r\n- Apply a box blur on the result\r\n\r\nIn Natron we support OpenFX which defines a standard for writing visual effects/image processing plug-ins for a compositing software. This is really important as today over 500 plug-in exist and are widely used by the cinema industry. Those plug-ins can implement cutting edge computer vision/graphics algorithms and this is where Natron can become helpful for the research and education in computer vision/graphics:\r\n\r\n500 lines of code are generally  enough to implement an OpenFX plug-in with multi-threading support. If you're worried about performances, GPU acceleration is possible with 3rd party libraries. \r\n\r\nOnce a plug-in has been developed you can couple it with other plug-ins and watch the results. Also it will work on all the softwares that currently support OpenFX, namely:\r\n\r\n- Nuke by the Foundry\r\n\r\n- Sony Vegas\r\n\r\n- Assimilate SCRATCH\r\n\r\n- DaVinci resolve by Blackmagic Design\r\n\r\n- DustBuster\r\n\r\n- Baselight\r\n\r\n- Autodesk Toxic\r\n\r\nand Natronâ€¦ which is the only open-source graphical software supporting it.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to be ready for production of visual effects on movies Natron has a few other features:\r\n\r\n- Animation of visual effects over the time\r\n\r\n- Performances and ability to deal with very large images (tested on 27000x15000 images)\r\n\r\n- Dozens of image/video file formats supported.\r\n\r\n- Color management via OpenColorIO\r\n\r\n- Command-line support for render farm purpose\r\n\r\nAs of today we're working on a rotoscoping node to be able to create and edit masks in Natron.\r\nPlease check out the full list of features and download Natron at: https://natron.inria.fr","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
